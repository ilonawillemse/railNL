# Visualize

```
This folder contains files that can visualize the output
```

It contains:
- a file which visualizes the outputfile into an animation (visualize_output.py)
- a file that plots the corresponding data (plot.py)
    - NOTE: to compare the algorithms we strongly advice to set the number of trajects in code_file/algoritms/baseline.py to a fixed number to keep the number of trajects equally between different algorithms. This way the comparing is more reliable.
